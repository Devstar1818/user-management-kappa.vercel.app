simple User management CRUD with next-js react framework, typescript for type checking, redux-toolkit for state management, chakra ui for component ui library and mongoDb for database, form handeling with formik and validation feilds with yup
I decided to do thes project to better understand api routes and start working with the backend in next js as fullstack react framework.
I also gained experinence working with rtk query next to the redux-toolkit.
And its strength was working with Typescript as a type checker for the project.

- add user
- delete user
- update user
- validation feild
